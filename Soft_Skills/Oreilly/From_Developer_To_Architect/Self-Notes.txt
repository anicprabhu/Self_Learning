		there is no Best solution, always a least worst solution. Always a balancing act.

		What do you when there are no best practices, when you are implementing a new idea for the first time, only try and improve

		How do we keep with our developers technically? we will never be able to keep up, buy we need to be technical enough to be respected, and have technical conversations with them, but they are the technical experts and that is OK

		Have a habit for Learning, attend conferences, do POC, present webinars

		Be able to translate requirements from a developer to architect

	You spend more time communicating via meetings, chats and creating documents
